Code Explanation (7 points)

Approach 1: Function with List Accumulation
The function doubleL(n) iterates through the range [0, n-1], computes i * 2 for each i, and appends the result to a list called res.
After completing the loop, it returns the list res.
The main loop then iterates through the list returned by doubleL(5) and prints each element, separated by : .

Approach 2: List Comprehension
A list comprehension [n * 2 for n in range(5)] creates a list by iterating through [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and computing n * 2 for each value.
This list is directly used in the for loop to print each element separated by : .
No separate function is defined, as the logic is handled inline by the comprehension.

Approach 3: Generator Function
The doubleG(n) function uses a generator with the yield statement. For each i in the range [0, n-1], i * 2 is computed and yielded to the caller.
The generator produces values one at a time (on demand) instead of storing them all in memory like a list.
The main loop iterates through the generator produced by doubleG(5) and prints each yielded value, separated by : .

Function Type and Advantage (3 points)
doubleG(n) is a generator function because it uses the yield keyword to produce values lazily, one at a time, without creating and storing the entire list in memory.

Advantages of Using doubleG(n) (Generator Function):

Memory Efficiency:
A generator does not store all the computed values in memory. Instead, it generates each value only when requested, making it ideal for working with large ranges or datasets.

Faster Initialization:
Generators avoid the overhead of creating and filling a list, leading to quicker startup times for large inputs.

Streamlined Execution:
Generators are particularly useful for processing large sequences in real-time or as part of a pipeline, avoiding unnecessary memory consumption.
